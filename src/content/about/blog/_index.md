## <span style="color:#4d80d1">OSCAL Continues to Grow Roots in Europe
### The European Cyber Security Organization convenes “Actions Beyond Words: Automating Audits for Streamlined Cybersecurity Policy Compliance in Europe”   </span>
### An awareness session on OSCAL for the European cybersecurity practitioners

  ##### -- Cristian Michael Tracci, Senior Manager, Policy Analysis and Outreach [policy@ecs-org.eu](mailto:policy@ecs-org.eu)

The European Cyber Security Organisation (ECSO) organizes an event titled “Actions Beyond Words: Automating Audits for Streamlined Cybersecurity Policy Compliance in Europe.” This session aims to discuss how to automate compliance to cybersecurity policies and security assessment, auditing, and continuous monitoring processes, raising awareness about the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL), its applications, and benefits in this domain. It is primarily addressed to the European cybersecurity community, including policymakers, GRC practitioners, and researchers, while also promoting dialogue between like-minded geographies on topics of common interest.
Organizations, whether private corporations, government agencies, or supervisory authorities, face significant challenges worldwide in managing compliance with various national and international laws, contractual clauses, and standards. The proliferation of cybersecurity regulations and standards in Europe exacerbates these challenges.
Fostering a collaborative approach, in line with its nature as a public-private partnership, ECSO can bring together the private and public sectors, promoting expert debate grounded in substantive discussions and focused on solutions that benefit the entire ecosystem.

I recently attended the OSCAL workshop titled "OSCAL-based AI-augmented CISO agent", hosted by our partners at IBM. The focus of the session was on leveraging OSCAL for AI-augmented compliance automation and policy validation. Over the past five years, IBM has made OSCAL a key part of their strategy for expressing security and compliance requirements across various domains, including infrastructure, data, AI, applications, and business processes. 

During the workshop, I learned about IBM's 4-step compliance lifecycle, with a particular emphasis on the assessment phase. The session detailed how IBM bridges authored compliance controls with real-time validation through their Compliance to Policy (C2P) framework. I was particularly impressed by how C2P uses OSCAL component definitions and a plug-in based architecture to generate technology-specific policies, such as Ansible playbooks or Kyverno rules. These policies are then deployed in actual or pre-deployment environments for validation. What really stood out to me was how the C2P core interprets OSCAL structures, mapping controls to relevant policies, and generating validation results into standardized OSCAL assessment outputs. This system seems like a game-changer for organizations looking to streamline their compliance processes.

Overall, the workshop gave me a deep dive into how structured compliance data, combined with Gen-AI and automated tools, can create a seamless and scalable compliance pipeline. I left the session with a solid understanding of how IBM is applying these technologies to modern cloud-native and AI-integrated systems. It's exciting to see how AI and automation are playing a key role in shaping the future of compliance.

## <span style="color:#4d80d1">OSCAL Foundation launches to move security standard forward   </span>

  ##### -- John Banghart [jfbanghart@venable.com](mailto:jfbanghart@venable.com)

The ability to automate security assessments to information technology systems is critical. It removes the possibility of human error and assists in overall security compliance. The Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) is a machine-readable language that automates, simplifies, and standardizes these assessments. 
OSCAL was originally developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in collaboration with FedRAMP and industry, and aims to improve the efficiency, timeliness, accuracy, and consistency of system security assessments and significantly reduce the associated paperwork. To carry this work forward, the OSCAL Foundation has launched to advance the development and adoption of OSCAL by industry and government.
The Foundation will focus on six objectives: adoption, education, community, development, extension, and internationalization.
The OSCAL Foundation will bring together communities to collaborate on advancing the use of the standard. The foundation has been created to offer support and resources for OSCAL and its community to increase adoption, new use cases, and integration into the globally recognized compliance standards. 
“NIST developed OSCAL to standardize the digitization of foundational risk management artifacts in support of the automated assessment and monitoring of system controls,” said Dr. Michaela Iorga of NIST. “OSCAL seeds the evolution of next-generation compliance processes and tools to facilitate interoperability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness with minimal human interaction. The OSCAL Foundation will bring the community support that we need to accelerate OSCAL adoption across the globe.”
The Foundation will host a kickoff event on Tuesday February 11th at 1 p.m. at Venable LLP in Washington, D.C. with a webinar viewing option available. Registration is required.
