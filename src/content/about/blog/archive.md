                <p>I recently attended the OSCAL workshop titled "OSCAL-based AI-augmented CISO agent", hosted by our partners at IBM. The focus of the session was on leveraging OSCAL for AI-augmented compliance automation and policy validation. Over the past five years, IBM has made OSCAL a key part of their strategy for expressing security and compliance requirements across various domains, including infrastructure, data, AI, applications, and business processes. 

During the workshop, I learned about IBM's 4-step compliance lifecycle, with a particular emphasis on the assessment phase. The session detailed how IBM bridges authored compliance controls with real-time validation through their Compliance to Policy (C2P) framework. I was particularly impressed by how C2P uses OSCAL component definitions and a plug-in based architecture to generate technology-specific policies, such as Ansible playbooks or Kyverno rules. These policies are then deployed in actual or pre-deployment environments for validation. What really stood out to me was how the C2P core interprets OSCAL structures, mapping controls to relevant policies, and generating validation results into standardized OSCAL assessment outputs. This system seems like a game-changer for organizations looking to streamline their compliance processes.

Overall, the workshop gave me a deep dive into how structured compliance data, combined with Gen-AI and automated tools, can create a seamless and scalable compliance pipeline. I left the session with a solid understanding of how IBM is applying these technologies to modern cloud-native and AI-integrated systems. It's exciting to see how AI and automation are playing a key role in shaping the future of compliance.</p>

The ability to automate security assessments to information technology systems is critical. It removes the possibility of human error and assists in overall security compliance. The Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) is a machine-readable language that automates, simplifies, and standardizes these assessments. 

OSCAL was originally developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in collaboration with FedRAMP and industry, and aims to improve the efficiency, timeliness, accuracy, and consistency of system security assessments and significantly reduce the associated paperwork. To carry this work forward, the OSCAL Foundation has launched to advance the development and adoption of OSCAL by industry and government.

The Foundation will focus on six objectives: adoption, education, community, development, extension, and internationalization.
The OSCAL Foundation will bring together communities to collaborate on advancing the use of the standard. The foundation has been created to offer support and resources for OSCAL and its community to increase adoption, new use cases, and integration into the globally recognized compliance standards. 

“NIST developed OSCAL to standardize the digitization of foundational risk management artifacts in support of the automated assessment and monitoring of system controls,” said Dr. Michaela Iorga of NIST. “OSCAL seeds the evolution of next-generation compliance processes and tools to facilitate interoperability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness with minimal human interaction. The OSCAL Foundation will bring the community support that we need to accelerate OSCAL adoption across the globe.”
The Foundation will host a kickoff event on Tuesday February 11th at 1 p.m. at Venable LLP in Washington, D.C. with a webinar viewing option available. Registration is required. More information is available [here](https://www.connect.venable.com/26/4611/landing-pages/rsvp-blank.asp?sid=blankform).

Welcome to the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) Blog, open to the NIST OSCAL Team and to the community! 

If you work closely with us, you might have noticed we finished [a large code repository reorganization](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/blob/f24dd56d5569ade8489924cf6fc2640dc297bfbe/decisions/0005-repository-reorganization.md) alongside [the release of OSCAL v1.1.0](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/releases/tag/v1.1.0) and the subsequent [OSCAL v1.1.1 release](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/releases/tag/v1.1.1). The OSCAL Project was in a desperate need of some internal restructuring, a fall cleaning of sorts. As an OSCAL user, the differences should not affect affect you, but we will still summarize some key changes for you. 

One may wonder why we reorganized our code repositories only recently. Our answer is simple: we started small (more than six years ago!) and wanted to keep everything in one place to reduce the maintenance overhead. As we expanded our work, we needed to separate code repositories to get better organized.
<br><br>
            <details>
                <summary><i>Click here to learn about what we changed:</i></summary>
- The OSCAL website's source code (known as OSCAL pages) moved to its own repository, [OSCAL-Pages](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL-Pages).
- The OSCAL reference documentation's source code moved to its own repository, [OSCAL-Reference](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL-Reference).
- The Metaschema tooling's source code, which we use to process OSCAL models and generate documentation, moved to its own repo, [metaschema-xslt](https://github.com/usnistgov/metaschema-xslt).
- The generated JSON and XML schemas for the models and converters for JSON-XML and XML-JSON conversion are only [published as part of releases](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/releases), they are not saved in the [OSCAL repo](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/) like source code anymore. We also [simplified the build process](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/blob/main/build/README.md), making it easier for community members to prototype and propose changes to the OSCAL models.

The NIST OSCAL Team officially maintains those new repos in addition to the existing [OSCAL](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/), [oscal-content](https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-content/), [liboscal-java](https://github.com/usnistgov/liboscal-java/), and [oscal-cli](https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-cli/) repositories. As priorities shifted, we have paused development on [oscal-cat, the catalog authoring tool](https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-cat), and [oscal-tools, a library of XSLT transformations for OSCAL developer use cases](https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-tools). Those projects are archived and remain available for reference and demonstration.

For an up-to-date description of all projects and their relationship to one another, please take a moment and review the [OSCAL project structure](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/about/projects/) on our website.

Moving forward, the NIST team will author future blog posts as needed. If you have an OSCAL topic you would like to read about or you want to guest-author a blog post, you can email the [NIST OSCAL team](mailto:oscal@nist.gov?subject=NIST%20Blog) your proposal and the team will work with you to approve and publish the blog post.
