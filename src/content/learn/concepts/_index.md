{{<callout>}}This concepts page serves as a gateway to essential information designed to help community members navigate and fully understand OSCAL. {{</callout>}}

Here, you'll find a curated collection of key resources, including detailed explanations of the terminology used in OSCAL, a breakdown of OSCAL's architecture and its various layers, and insights into the types of identifiers OSCAL supports. You'll also discover practical guidance on profile resolution, risk management implementation, and examples of how to work with OSCAL data in formats like XML, JSON, and YAML. Additionally, there is an overview of how OSCAL aligns with other document standards.
